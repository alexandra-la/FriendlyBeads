My project is called Friendly Beads, which is an online beaded friendship bracelet designer. Right now, the only way to design these beaded friendship bracelets is either with paper or a notes app on your phone. Friendship bracelets have become increasingly popular in the past year, with people trading them showing up at a variety of different events, from concerts to Formula 1 races. Their popularity in such a vast number of events shows just how diverse the user base for such an application could be. Friendly Beads would solve both these problems by being a concentrated location to create and share various beaded friendship bracelet designs. They would be able to input information about the types of beads they wish to use and other details about the bracelet, as well as tag the design with various categories that it relates to. Users would then post these designs as they are saved. After a user has made a bracelet, they would be able to mark the bracelet as made and upload an image of the final product. Users would also be able to search the various designs and save them for later use, being able to see the details of the designed bracelet. After making and saving designs, users would begin to receive targeted recommendations for designs of bracelets.
